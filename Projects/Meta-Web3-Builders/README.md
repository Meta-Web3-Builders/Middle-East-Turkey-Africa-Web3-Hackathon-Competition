### Project Introduction
Stable Bank DAO is a group effort to address the world's most pressing problems.
The Stable Bank DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization governed by a set of rules and protocols established by its members. </br>
Individuals can join the DAO under certain conditions and propose a solution to a global issue or community project, after which every DAO member can vote with the DAO token.</br>
A proposal can only be created by a DAO member, and once approved by a majority (70%) of the DAO's members, it is automatically open to the public for funding. Stable Bank DAO members can also contribute to the DAO to help fund the project.
Furthermore,  everyone who contributes to the fundraising will receive an NFT award(Stable Bank NFT).
